Please describe the context in which you worked with Ming.

At Skinblu I had the pleasure of working closely with Ming as a fellow software engineer and mentor. Together we spearheaded the design and development of the Skinblu app. Ming would often work to implement the features and I would provide any support he needed. We would aim to meet a few times a week, often spending that time to manage tasks, pair program, and plan for the upcoming week. Aside from working professionally with Ming, I also acted as his mentor and continue to do so. As such, I aimed to draw from my experience to provide him with perspective, guidance, and opportunity.

What were Ming's greatest individual contributions to the team and company?

Ming's greatest individual contribution to Skinblu was leading the development of the core feature. He was very motivated to drive progress and collaborated well with other team members. Given that he was able to be a multidisciplinary engineer capable of taking an idea and materializing it. His full-stack knowledge of the application allowed him to contribute valuable insight into various decision-making processes. In addition, his passion for product design coupled with his proactive personality and technical skills made him a driving force for many product features.
